# Easybank Landing page

This front-end coding challenge was taken from https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN.

Completed project deployed here https://easybank-landing-page.netlify.app/

## The Challenge

Within this repo, I have created a landing page for a fake banking website. Project was built using Vue.js framework. A mixture of SCSS and HTML was used to achieve styling as close to the design as possible, and Javascript was used to achieve the functionality of the website.

### What it does

You should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
